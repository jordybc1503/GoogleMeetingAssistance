# Google Meeting Assistant

A lightweight browser script that transforms Google Meet captions into a click-to-copy interface and auto-generates answers via the OpenAI API.

## Features

- **Click‚Äëto‚ÄëCopy Captions**: Simply click any caption in Google Meet to copy its text.
- **AI‚ÄëPowered Replies**: Sends the copied caption to a GPT model and logs the assistant‚Äôs response in the console.
- **Customizable System Prompt**: Define your own instructions for the AI model at runtime.

## Requirements

- **OpenAI API Key**: A valid key with permission to use the GPT chat endpoint.
- **Browser Console Access**: Ability to paste and execute JavaScript in your browser‚Äôs developer console.

## Installation & Setup

1. **Open Google Meet** in your browser and join or start a meeting.
2. **Open the Developer Console** (e.g., `Ctrl+Shift+I` or `Cmd+Option+I`).
3. **Allow Clipboard Paste**:
   - If pasting is disabled, type `allow paste` in the console and press Enter.
4. **Configure the Script**:
   - Copy the entire script source (provided in the repo or snippet below).
   - In the console, paste the script and press Enter.
5. **Enter Your System Prompt** when prompted (this becomes the AI‚Äôs instructions).

## Usage

- **Answering Questions**: During your meeting, when a participant asks a question, click on the caption text in the video stream. The text will be copied to your clipboard and sent to the GPT model. The AI‚Äôs reply will appear in the console.

````js
// Example console log:
// üìã Copied: "How do I declare a variable for last name?"
// GPT‚Äë4o Mini says: "In JavaScript, you can declare a variable for a last name like this:\n```
````

## Configuration Options

- **Model Selection**: By default, the script uses `gpt-4o-mini`. You can change this in the fetch URL or payload.
- **Prompt Customization**: Re-run the script and provide a new system prompt to adjust the AI‚Äôs behavior.

## Troubleshooting

- **Clipboard Errors**: Ensure your browser settings allow programmatic copy/paste operations.
- **API Errors**: Check that your OpenAI API key is correct and has sufficient permissions.
- **Rate Limits**: Be mindful of your OpenAI rate limits; reduce click frequency if you encounter throttling.
